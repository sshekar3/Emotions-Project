    "In this project, the goal of the emotion identification is to be used for a chatbot for the purpose of crisis text/therapy etc. For this purpose, it is more important that the model is correctly identifying an emotion when it labels one rather than catching every instance of every emotion. For example, it is ok if the chatbot does not recognize every instance of someone saying something that indicates sadness. However, it is important that the chatbot does not mistake sadness for happiness. So, precision is the primary metric to be maximized in this model while still having decent recall and ability to identify different emotions. "

    "Looking at the different models here, Random Forest provides the best precision while still identifying most of the emotions. While Naive Bayes has a higher precision in theory, it does so by simply ignoring most of the emotions (shown by the very low recall number). The advantage of random forest is that it can also continue to be adapted for more emotions with appropriately scaling complexity. "
