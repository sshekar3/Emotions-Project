Problem statement formation 
Can you make a chatbot do ‘emotion labeling’ accurately and consistently given relevant text? 

Context 
‘Emotion labeling’ is a powerful tool in crisis intervention, psychotherapy. By labeling the specific emotion that an individual is expressing, the individual can often regulate their feelings and gain a deeper understanding of their emotional situation. 


Criteria for success
The model is able to accurately label emotions over 90 % of the time. 


 Scope of solution space 
Using the GoEmotions database of 58,000 carefully curated comments extracted from Reddit, with human annotations to 27 emotion categories or Neutral.




Constraints 
Data is from online platform of Reddit, often in the form of comments rather than conversational speech 
Data is not necessarily representative of people in crisis, or seeking therapeutic help
Data is likely biased in demographics of Reddit users (usually young males) 
List of relevant emotions is much larger than 27 used in this database 

Stakeholders 
Crisis line centers
Therapists
911 centers
